# HTML

## Introduction
HTML is used to create web pages that we see every day on the Internet.


## Doctype

```html
<!Doctype HTML>
```
Doctype is the first piece of code to write in HTML5 to inform a browser that the document being rendered is an HTML document. 
```<!doctype html>, <!Doctype HTML>, <!DOCTYPE HTML>``` all are the same because the doctype keyword is not case sensitive.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an “information” to the browser about what document type to expect.
