# React

## When to use React ?
 - **Large Amount of Interaction and Data Changes:** When your website has a lot of user interaction and frequent data changes, managing these updates efficiently becomes crucial. React excels in handling such scenarios because of its virtual DOM mechanism, which allows it to efficiently update only the parts of the page that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire page each time.
 - **Single Page Applications (SPAs):** SPAs, where the entire application is loaded once and subsequent interactions with the server are handled dynamically without full page reloads, benefit greatly from React.
